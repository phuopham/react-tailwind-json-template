# tailwind + react + vite + JSON template

This is the easy way to create a static page with react. The only thing you need to do it clone the repository and start implement your code. I also put a demo how to pull data from JSON file. Using JSON file for content help you centralize all the input data. It should be the only file you need to look into in case of changing content.
